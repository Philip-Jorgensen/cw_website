# Christian Wallpapers website
This is the code for the Christian Wallpapers website, I am using this website as a way to practice my Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Python and then I have an actual use for it aswell.
The link for the website is: <a href="http://christianwallpapers.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank">http://christianwallpapers.pythonanywhere.com/</a>

<a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/ChristianWallpapers/webapps/#tab_id_christianwallpapers_pythonanywhere_com" target="_blank">Admin link</a>

## Features to be implemented:
- Download button on the images
- Make a better looking about page
- Login page for admin to upload new wallpapers
- Add a share button for the wallpapers to facebook and other social media platforms
  -   <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/share-button/">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/share-button/</a>
  -   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBaw_6cPmAw
-   Setup API control for both Facebook and Instragram so it automatically uploads to those places when I upload to the website.
